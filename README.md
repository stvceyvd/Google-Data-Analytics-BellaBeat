# Google Data Analytics Certificate Case Study - How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play it Smart?

### Introduction
For my [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite-gDigital-paidha-sem-bk-gen-exa-glp-br-null&_ga=2.244797261.950290879.1660862123-1096932820.1658185357&_gac=1.149812676.1658444207.Cj0KCQjw8uOWBhDXARIsAOxKJ2HwpFHSnMZDJDQv74Qkx3-MUYDeY6LNt4vm-XZ9zN0puUniH0tZM0kaAlafEALw_wcB) capstone project, I will be conducting a case study. Following the steps of data analysis taught by the course (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act), I will be analyzing a dataset also provided by the course, as if I were a junior data analyst working on the marketing team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.

### About Bellabeat 
Based in San Francisco, [Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/) is a wellness company that focuses on health-focused smart technology. Its mission is to empower women to reconnect within themselves and unlock their full potential, through biometrics and lifestyle data.

### Scenario 
Bellabeat is a small successful company that has the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices, to help guide marketing strategy for the company.

### Business Task
Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, and apply these insights to a comparable Bellabeat product such as the Bellabeat Time.

**Primary Stakeholders:**
Urška Sršen, Bellabeat's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer
Sando Mur, Bellabeat's co-founder and a key member of the Bellabeat executive team. 

**Secondary Stakeholders:**
Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

### About the Data 
Provided by Google, the datasource used for this case study is [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit), made available by Mobius and stored on the data science website, Kaggle. It was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between April 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

**Limitations**
Using the ROCCC approach learned during the course, I will address any limitations within the data set. 
- Reliability: There were only a total of 30 people who took part in the survey. However, data shows that there were actually 33. Still, this is may not be an accurate representation of all Fitbit users with such a relatively small sample size and unknown demographic information. 
- Original: The data comes from a third-party source via Amazon Mechanical Turk, meaning there is no direct relationship between the entity and respondents. 
- Comprehensive: Dataset contains minute-level output for physical intensities, heart-rate, and sleep monitoring and also multiple attributes for most of the table
- Current: The data is old and reflects trends from 2016. Since then, Bellabeat and Fitbit have both released new products with advanced technology that better track lifestyle data.
- Cited: The data was collected by a third party source, so citation is known. 

Overall, this data set does not meet the ROCCC standard and is not recommendeded to make business decisions. 

**Additional limitations:** 
Some responsdants did not wear their Fitbit for the entirity of the 30-day period, which could account for the missing records. 

For my analysis, I've decided to **focus** on daily/hourly usage of the Fitbit device. The three tables I selected from the dataset to analyze are dailyActivities_merged, sleepDay_merged, and hourlyIntensities_merged.

### Data Processing 
For this case study, I used Microsoft Excel and BigQuery SQL to clean and transform the data. I began the clean process by checking for: blank spaces, duplicates, misleading records, and any inconsistencies.
