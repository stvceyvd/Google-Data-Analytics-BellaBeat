# Google Data Analytics Certificate Case Study - How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play itÂ Smart?

### Introduction
For my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone project, I will be conducting a case study. Following the steps of data analysis taught by the course (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act), I will be analyzing a dataset also provided by the course, as if I were a junior data analyst working on the marketing team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.
